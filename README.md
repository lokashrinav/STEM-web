This website was created soley with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

There is a bug that appears when you change the width of the screen that I'm unable to fix right now and plan to fix later. 

There is also another bug with overlapping text and images that occurs when the width of the screen is too small, which I also plan to fix later. 

There are a total of 7 pages, including the title page. Aside from the title page, there are several pages, including Languages, Where to Code?, Hackathons, Competitive Programming, Coding Jobs, and Where to Code. 

This website offers helpful tips to get started with coding and for people already experienced with coding and what they can do as coders.

If you could give some feedback to improve this site, it would be helpful.
