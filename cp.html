                        Don't get confused between Competitive Programming and Hackathons! Competitive Programming is typically associated with finding a solution
                        to a programming algorithmic problem, while Hackathons are project-based. These coding problems could be super easy or terrifyingly scary! Competitive Programming is super fun and something you should try
                        out at least once if you decide to become a coder!

                        Although this competition is targeted towards high schoolers, non-high schoolers can still compete (However, you won't be able to join the IOI USA Team). USACO also offers one of the best training materials for competitive programming
                        created by previous participants called the USACO Guide. Make sure to check it out.
